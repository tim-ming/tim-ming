# Who am I?
I'm **Tim Ming**. Hi! 🙋‍♂️<br>
I like to be creative, particularly in creating websites.<br>
My interests include developing web aesthetics, usability (UX) and 3D web.
<br>
<br>

## Stack 📚
I tinker with some well-known <code>tech stuff</code>:

## Projects 🗄️
Some side-projects I've created in my spare time.
### [Nekoworld](https://github.com/timming-au/kuroneko)
A simple `Threejs` based low-poly planetary system simulation built with Threlte.<br>
This was the result of two-week sprint to learn 3D web fundamentals, along with 3D modeling, and performance optimisations in mind.<br>
All 3D assets were created with `Blender` by me, while 2D assets were hand-drawn/`midjourney`.
<br>
<br>

## WIP 🚧
Side-projects that are in development.
### Portfolio
I'm currently working on my [portfolio website](https://kotimi.dev). It will be built in React and Threejs (RTF)<br>
<br>
